this is my desperate tries to make sense out of the studies i made about deep learning n neural networks
the code is supposed to be used to classify essays using convolutional neural networks , inspired by phd of Xiang Zhang,
dataset is pretty small i literally made these hyper parameters up none of the tutorials, books or papers talked about how you choose your strides kernels kernel sizes and all that 
so it may not be of any help to someone who is trying to reach same goal

at any rate libraries used are numpy, theano and lasagne (pretty useful and well documented for machine learning neural nets and deep neural nets)
